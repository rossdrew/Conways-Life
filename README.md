# Conways Life

Imported from my long dead Sourceforge.net account.
They say that when you look at your code from 6 months ago, if you aren't disgusted then you've stopped evolving as a developer.  This code is much older than that and I'm very glad to say that I am beyond disgusted with this code.

So I thought it would be fun to bring it back to life and work on it to make it less ugly.
